# Hack

(19/06/25)

The server got hacked. The hackers put up a scam on the notice board, banned all
the real mods, and then also proceeded to ban a bunch of random people for little or
no reason, all under [nick](../users/f-n/nick.md)'s (now compromised) account.

Currently, the [duck cult](duck-cult.md) server and a temporary replacement server
named "World of Coders", created by moogly are being used.
