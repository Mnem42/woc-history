The duck cult is an important aspect of the server's legacy. It is a cult created
by "Duckie | Duck Cult Leader", an ambitious duck that aims to defend the rights of
the superior ducks against the wild, barbarian and uneducated humans who violate
them. And also geese. And some birds.

Members include nameunknown, duckie, evil, and many others, many of which are active
and help spread the holy message of the duck cult.
