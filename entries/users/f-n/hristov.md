![Is ok](https://badgen.net/static/status/ok/green?icon=discord)

**Aliases**: *"GOD of WoC"*, *"Gopnik of WoC"*  

Is a Bulgarian web dev, a self-proclaimed gopnik, and a former co-owner. Known for his questionable life choices, deep involvement in tech shenanigans**, and occasional **controversies** (because why not?).  

## Things he does

- Web Dev & Web Design like a true gopnik (with Adidas tracksuit energy)  
- Studies computer Engineering (allegedly)  
- Has been in multiple controversies but somehow still thrives  
- Drinks excessive amounts of caffeine to function  

## Legacy  
Hristov's impact on the internet remains… *dubious*, but he keeps coding anyway. Whether he's a genius or just winging it — we may never know. One thing is for sure: if it's webdev, he is in the trenches.

> "Just write code, squat, and hope for the best." – Probably Hristov
