# Introduction

*This was written almost entirely by mtf*

Greetings, dear readers.

"Unofficial History of WoC" - one would ask the purpose behind this book. Why should one care about a small, close-knit Discord server about coding? Why should I write this book? The answer to these questions will be revealed as you read on.

This server is not just any Discord server—it is a palace of memories, friends, fun, and jokes. Its culture and traditions are unlike any other. My main goal in writing this book is to preserve these memories, traditions, and moments so that, decades from now, we can still look back and remember the fun we had.

In this book, you will come across terms such as "swololo," "delulu," or "panini." Rest assured, their meanings will become clear soon enough. Additionally, some notable figures who shaped the server include: Verq, Disassembled, MTF Alpha 1 and its alts, Dragon and its alts, Jack Ma and its alts, Swololo, Tony Stark, Rolfan and many more. This book is not just for the sake of reading but for the sake of remembrance.

Moreover, this is from the “citizen’s perspective”. We do not know the struggles of countless mods and admins who protect this community for whom they are responsible for and care for.

I am just a newcomer, passing by, seeing the fun they had- no, they fun WE had. This server is over 4 years old, and the incidents that will mainly be recounted are only over 2 years old or younger. Please forgive me if any error occurs, I hereby accept all responsibility for this memorial.

Before we begin, let us get familiar with some of our members.
